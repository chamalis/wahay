<p><strong>Hashes:</strong><br><br>
     Digital hashes protect against unintentional modification of data in
     transit. They help you make sure that you get the same data as what was
     sent from the website. They do NOT protect against any kind of attack.
     To verify the integrity of the file you need to obtain the SHA-256 of
     the binary you have downloaded and compare it with the associated file
     wahay-xxxxx.sha256.sum. For example, if you want to check the sha256sum
     of wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d binary:
<br>

<br><br>
<div class="code">
<br>
$ sha256sum wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d<br>
f75a4b04d05571d5eb7dff267c1efa996b1e24ff9a8d84c4fa1088141dc48cf8  wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d<br>
</div>
<br>The output of the previous command should be compared with the content of the wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d.sha256sum file.
<br><br>

<div class="code">
<br>
$ cat wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d.sha256sum<br>
f75a4b04d05571d5eb7dff267c1efa996b1e24ff9a8d84c4fa1088141dc48cf8  bin/wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d<br>
</div>
<br>

If the output of both is the same, then the binary has not been modified in transit, otherwise your file has been corrupted, and you should try to download it again.

<p><strong>Signatures:</strong><br><br>
     Digital signatures ensure that what CAD intended to publish is the
     same as what was published. It protects against attacks where the binary or
     source code has been modified by an attacker on the website, or modified
     in transit from the website to your system. It does NOT protect against
     attacks where the source code has been modified in our repositories, or
     when the build system has been compromised.<br><br>

1) Download the current signing key for CAD:<br>
<code>
<br>$ wget https://wahay.app/cad-testing-public-key.asc
</code>

<br><br>
2) Import the public key:<br>
<div class="code">
<br>$ gpg --import cad-testing-public-key.asc<br>
gpg: key F3B1159FC97D5490: public key "CAD Signing Key - testing (This is a test key) <gpg@autonomia.digital>" imported<br>
gpg: Total number processed: 1<br>
gpg:               imported: 1<br>
</div>
<br><br>

3) Verify hash signature<br>
<div class="code">
<br>$ gpg --verify wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d.sha256sum.asc wahay-2020-01-22-9319d8d.sha256sum<br>
gpg: Signature made mi√© 22 ene 2020 10:06:02 -05<br>
gpg:                using EDDSA key A5DA0791073C1374BB2A98B3A5ABBD2E8E623464<br>
<strong>gpg: Good signature from "CAD Signing Key - testing (This is a test key) \<gpg@autonomia.digital\>"</strong> [unknown]<br>
<strong>gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!</strong><br>
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.<br>
Primary key fingerprint: 0124 2FFA B8CE 1EC0 C8F5  4456 A885 4162 D28F 171E<br>
     Subkey fingerprint: A5DA 0791 073C 1374 BB2A  98B3 A5AB BD2E 8E62 3464<br>
</div>
<br><br>
If you see the message: "gpg: Good signature from "CAD Signing Key -
testing (This is a test key) ", that means that the signature is
valid. However, if you get the following warning: "This key is not
certified with a trusted signature!", it is because the key is not
trusted.
